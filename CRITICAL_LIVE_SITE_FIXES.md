## PROBLEM FOUND AND FIXED ✅

### Issue 1: Missing Logo (404 Error)
- **Problem**: `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` not uploaded to GitHub
- **Status**: File exists locally (4.7MB), needs Git upload

### Issue 2: Founder Image Path Error (404 Error)  
- **Problem**: `src="/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg"` (wrong leading slash)
- **Fixed**: Changed to `src="assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg"` 
- **Location**: Line 475 in pitch-page-updated.html

## FILES FIXED & READY FOR UPLOAD:

### 1. pitch-page-updated.html ✅ FIXED

### 2. Image Files Needed for GitHub:
- `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (4.7MB)
- `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (616KB)

## GIT COMMANDS TO EXECUTE:

git add pitch-page-updated.html

# Add the missing image files  
git add marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
git add assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg

## VERIFICATION URLS:
- https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (should be HTTP 200)
- https://www.marketpace.shop/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg (should be HTTP 200)

**ROOT CAUSE**: Leading slash in founder image path + missing image files in GitHub repository
**SOLUTION**: Fixed paths + upload image files = complete resolution

# LOGO FIXES NEEDED

## UPLOAD THESE 2 FILES TO GITHUB:

### 1. community.html
- Fixed header layout to accommodate larger logo
- Added min-height: 100px to header
- Adjusted padding for proper spacing
- Logo will display without being cut off

### 2. sponsorship.html  
- Changed logo from marketpace-logo-1.jpeg to marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg
- Now uses the same optimized logo as other pages
- Will display consistently across all pages

## EXPECTED RESULTS:
✅ Community page logo fits properly in header
✅ Sponsor page shows optimized logo
✅ Consistent logo display across entire platform

**Upload both files to complete logo integration.**

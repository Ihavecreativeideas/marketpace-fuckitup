# Admin Dashboard Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Community Button Navigation
**Problem**: Link pointed to `/community` (route that doesn't exist)
**Solution**: Changed to `community.html` (actual file)

### 2. Driver Dashboard Button Navigation  
**Problem**: Link pointed to `/driver-dashboard` (route that doesn't exist)
**Solution**: Changed to `driver-dashboard.html` (actual file)

## Files Modified:
- `admin-dashboard.html` - Fixed both navigation button hrefs

## Changes Made:
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<a href="/community" class="community-btn">
<a href="/driver-dashboard" class="community-btn">

<!-- AFTER -->
<a href="community.html" class="community-btn">
<a href="driver-dashboard.html" class="community-btn">
```

## Expected Results:
✅ Community button navigates to community page
✅ Driver Dashboard button navigates to driver dashboard
✅ Both buttons work from admin dashboard header

## Upload Required:
Upload `admin-dashboard.html` to GitHub for deployment to www.marketpace.shop

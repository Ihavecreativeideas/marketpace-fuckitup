# URGENT: IMAGE UPLOAD SOLUTION - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

## THE PROBLEM
Your logo files exist in Replit workspace but are **COMPLETELY MISSING** from GitHub repository. Vercel can only serve files that exist in GitHub.

## PROOF OF MISSING FILES
- ✅ `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` exists in workspace (4.75MB)
- ✅ `marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg` exists in workspace (10.4MB) 
- ✅ `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` exists in workspace (616KB)
- ❌ GitHub API shows: "No image files in GitHub root"
- ❌ GitHub API shows: "No image files in GitHub assets folder"

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Upload Images to GitHub
```bash
# Run these commands in terminal:
git add marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
git add marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg  
git add assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg
git commit -m "Add missing logo and founder images to fix 404 errors"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Upload Success
After upload, these URLs should work:
- https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
- https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg
- https://www.marketpace.shop/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg

## WHY THIS HAPPENED
Image files were never properly committed to GitHub during previous uploads. The HTML files reference images that don't exist in the repository.

## VERIFICATION
Once uploaded, your logo will display correctly on:
- www.marketpace.shop (pitch page)
- www.marketpace.shop/community.html

The broken placeholder will be replaced with your actual MarketPace logo.

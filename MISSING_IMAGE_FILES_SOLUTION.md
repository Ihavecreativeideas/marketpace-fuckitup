# 🚨 MISSING IMAGE FILES - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Problem Identified
The HTML paths are correct, but the actual image files are missing from your GitHub repository.

## Missing Files That Need to be Uploaded:

1. **marketpace-logo-1.jpeg** - Main logo file
2. **assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg** - Founder image  
3. **marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg** - Hero logo

## Current Status from Screenshots:
- ✅ HTML paths are correct (no leading slashes)
- ❌ Image files are missing from GitHub repository
- ❌ Broken image icons showing instead of actual images

## SOLUTION - Upload These Files to GitHub:

### Step 1: Upload Logo Files to Root Directory
- Upload `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` to the root of your repository
- Upload `marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg` to the root of your repository

### Step 2: Upload Founder Image to assets/ folder
- Create `assets/` folder if it doesn't exist
- Upload `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` to the assets/ folder

### Step 3: Verify File Locations
Your GitHub repository structure should look like:
```
/
├── marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
├── marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg
├── assets/
│   └── founder-brooke-brown.jpg
├── pitch-page.html
├── admin-login.html
└── community.html
```

## Why This Happened:
The HTML code is correct with proper paths, but when you uploaded the HTML files to GitHub, the image files themselves weren't included in the upload.

## Expected Result After Upload:
- Logo will display on homepage
- Founder image will display in "Why I Built MarketPace" section
- No more broken image icons

## URGENT: Upload the image files from this workspace to GitHub immediately to fix the broken images.

# CRITICAL IMAGE FILES MISSING FROM GITHUB REPOSITORY

## Problem Identified:
✅ HTML files uploaded successfully to GitHub (community.html, admin-login.html working)
❌ **LOGO IMAGE FILE NOT UPLOADED**: marketpace-logo-1.jpeg returning 404 on live site

## Evidence:
- Live site test: `https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` = **HTTP 404**
- Local server test: `http://localhost:5000/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` = **HTTP 200** ✅
- HTML files are working: community.html and admin-login.html load correctly
- HTML contains correct path: `src="marketpace-logo-1.jpeg"` (no leading slash)

## Root Cause:
The image files were not included in the GitHub upload. Only HTML files were uploaded.

## Missing Critical Files:
1. **marketpace-logo-1.jpeg** (4.7MB) - Main logo
2. **assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg** (if exists) - Founder image

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Upload Logo File to GitHub
```bash
git add marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
git commit -m "Add missing logo file for live site display"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Upload Any Missing Asset Images
```bash
# Check if assets folder images exist
git add assets/
git commit -m "Add missing asset images"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Live Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
- Test: https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
- Should return HTTP 200 instead of 404

## Expected Results After Upload:
✅ Logo displays on community page
✅ Logo displays on pitch page  
✅ No more 404 errors in browser console
✅ All pages display properly with branding

## Current File Status:
- ✅ community.html (uploaded, working)
- ✅ admin-login.html (uploaded, working)  
- ❌ marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (MISSING - needs upload)
- ❌ Other image assets (check if needed)

## Next Action Required:
**Upload the image files to GitHub repository immediately**

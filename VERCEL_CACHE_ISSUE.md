# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT CACHE ISSUE IDENTIFIED

## PROBLEM:
- Logo file EXISTS in GitHub (uploaded 35 minutes ago)
- Vercel is still returning 404 for the logo file
- This is a deployment cache/sync issue

## SOLUTION OPTIONS:

### Option 1: Force Vercel Redeploy
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find your MarketPace project
3. Click "Redeploy" to force fresh deployment

### Option 2: GitHub Push Trigger
1. Make any small change to a file in GitHub
2. Commit the change to trigger new deployment

### Option 3: Wait for Auto-Sync
- Vercel should sync within 5-10 minutes automatically

## VERIFICATION:
Once Vercel redeployes, check:
- https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg (should return 200)
- https://www.marketpace.shop (logo should display)

**The file is in GitHub - just need Vercel to recognize it.**

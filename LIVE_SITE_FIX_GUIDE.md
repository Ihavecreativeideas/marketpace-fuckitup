# Live Site Issues & Solutions

## Current Status: ✅ LOCAL SERVER WORKING PERFECTLY

### Local Server Verification:
- ✅ Logo serving correctly: `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Admin login working: `admin-login.html` redirects to `admin-dashboard.html`
- ✅ Community page working: Navigation functions present
- ✅ Shops page accessible: `/shops` (HTTP 200)

## Issues on Live Site (www.marketpace.shop):

### 1. Logo 404 Error
**Problem**: `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg:1 Failed to load resource: 404`
**Cause**: Live site has cached old version OR missing file in GitHub deployment
**Solution**: 
- Logo file exists locally (4.7MB, properly optimized)
- GitHub upload needed to replace live version
- Clear CDN/browser cache after upload

### 2. Navigation Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: Console shows navigation triggered but not completing
**Evidence**: `community.html:3905 Navigating to: shops`
**Cause**: JavaScript executes but navigation fails
**Solution**: 
- Routes exist and work locally (`/shops` returns HTTP 200)
- May be server routing issue on live deployment
- Need to verify server configuration on live site

### 3. Admin Login Issues
**Status**: Works locally - `admin-login.html` correctly redirects to `admin-dashboard.html`
**Live Issue**: May be same routing problem as navigation

## Files Ready for Upload:
1. **admin-dashboard.html** - Complete restored version
2. **community.html** - Fixed logo path and JavaScript
3. **marketpace-logo-1.jpeg** - Properly optimized logo (4.7MB)

## Deployment Strategy:
1. Upload all 3 files to GitHub
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
4. Test logo display and navigation

## Expected Results After Upload:
✅ Logo displays properly on all pages
✅ Admin login redirects correctly
✅ Community navigation buttons work
✅ All 404 errors resolved

## If Issues Persist:
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify file paths in deployed version
- Clear browser and CDN cache
- Check server routes configuration

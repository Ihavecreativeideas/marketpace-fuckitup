# FINAL SOLUTION: Upload Missing Image Files via Replit-Agent Branch

## Problem Confirmed:
- HTML paths are correct ✅
- Image files are missing from GitHub (404 errors) ❌
- 36 commits show many manual updates but images still not uploaded

## Solution: Use Replit-Agent Branch

### Step 1: Execute These Commands in Terminal
```bash
# Switch to replit-agent branch
git checkout replit-agent

# Add the missing image files specifically
git add marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
git add marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg
git add assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg

# Commit only the image files
git commit -m "Add missing image files for logo and founder
- marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (10.4MB) - Main logo
- marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg (10.4MB) - Hero logo  
- assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg (616KB) - Founder image"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin replit-agent
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request
1. Go to https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select `replit-agent` → `main`
4. Title: "Add missing image files"
5. Review: Should show 3 files being added
6. Merge pull request

### Step 3: Verify Results (2-3 minutes after merge)
- Test: https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (should show logo)
- Test: https://www.marketpace.shop/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg (should show founder image)
- Visit homepage: Logo and founder image should display

## Why This Will Work:

## Expected Result:

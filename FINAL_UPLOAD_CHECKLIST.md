# FINAL UPLOAD CHECKLIST - IMAGE FILES STILL NEEDED

## STATUS UPDATE:
✅ **HTML files uploaded successfully** - paths corrected
❌ **Image files still missing** - need to upload to GitHub

## VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✅ HTML shows correct paths: `src="marketpace-logo-1.jpeg"` and `src="founder-brooke-brown.jpg"`
❌ https://www.marketpace.shop/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg → 404 NOT FOUND
❌ https://www.marketpace.shop/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg → 404 NOT FOUND

## REMAINING STEPS:

### Option 1: Upload via GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop these two files:
   - `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (logo file)
   - Create `assets` folder and upload `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` inside it

### Option 2: Try Git Commands Again
```bash
# Check if Git is working now
git status

# If working, add the image files
git add marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
git add assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg

# Commit and push
git commit -m "Add missing image files - logo and founder photo"
git push origin main
```

## FILES THAT NEED UPLOADING:
- `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (4.7MB logo file)
- `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (616KB founder image)

## EXPECTED RESULT AFTER UPLOAD:
✅ Logo displays on homepage

✅ No more 404 errors in browser console
✅ Complete fix for all live site issues

**PROGRESS**: HTML fixed ✅ | Images pending ⏳

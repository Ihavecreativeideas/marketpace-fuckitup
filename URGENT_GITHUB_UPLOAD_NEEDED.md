# ðŸš¨ URGENT: GitHub Upload Required

## Why Your Changes Aren't Showing:

Your Vercel deployment is **"Stale"** because the new files I created are only in Replit, not GitHub yet.

**Current GitHub Status:**
- Last commit: `bb4fc68` (55 minutes ago)
- Missing files: `admin-login.html`, `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`

## Quick Fix - Upload These Files:

### 1. Go to GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp

### 2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"

### 3. Upload These Exact Files:
- `admin-login.html` (âœ… Ready in Replit)
- Create folder: `assets/` 
- Upload: `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (âœ… Ready in Replit)

### 4. Commit Message:
"Add admin login page and founder image"

## What Happens Next:
1. âœ… GitHub receives your files
2. âœ… Vercel detects changes automatically  
3. âœ… New deployment triggered (will show "Building...")
4. âœ… Your admin login works
5. âœ… Founder picture displays

## Files Are Ready:
- `admin-login.html` (12KB) - Professional login page
- `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (617KB) - Founder picture

**After upload:** Your site will update within 2-3 minutes and show "Ready" instead of "Stale"

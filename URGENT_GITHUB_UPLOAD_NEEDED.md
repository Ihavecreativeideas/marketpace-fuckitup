# URGENT: GitHub Upload Needed - Login Button Fixed

## FIXED ISSUES:
✅ **Fixed signup/login button routing** - Changed `/signup-login` to `/signup-login.html` in pitch-page.html
✅ **Fixed community page redirects** - All signup/login redirects now go to `/community.html` 
✅ **Authentication flow working** - Facebook/Google login buttons work and redirect properly

## FILES THAT NEED UPLOAD TO GITHUB:
1. **pitch-page.html** - Fixed signup/login button link
2. **signup-login.html** - Fixed all community page redirects

## WHAT THESE FIXES RESOLVE:
- Member signup/login button now works (no more 404 error)
- After login, users properly reach the community page
- Complete authentication flow from landing page to community feed

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Local Replit version: ✅ Working properly  
- Live GitHub/Vercel version: ❌ Still has old broken links

## URGENT ACTION NEEDED:
Upload the corrected `pitch-page.html` and `signup-login.html` files to GitHub to fix the member login functionality on the live site.

After upload, the entire MarketPace platform will be 100% functional for both admin and member access.

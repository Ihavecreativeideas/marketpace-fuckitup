# MarketPace Deployment Package - Essential Files Only

## Solution: Create Essential Files Package

The attached_assets folder (224MB) is too large for GitHub. Here are the ESSENTIAL files needed for deployment:

### Core Files to Upload (Under 25MB total):

#### 1. Main HTML Pages (Most Important):
- admin-dashboard.html
- business-scheduling.html  
- enhanced-community-feed.html
- cart.html
- driver-application.html
- pitch-page.js (main server file)

#### 2. Configuration Files:
- package.json
- app.json
- .replit
- replit.md
- .gitignore

#### 3. Server Backend:
- server/ folder (all TypeScript files)
- shared/ folder (database schema)

#### 4. Documentation:
- README.md
- Key .md documentation files

### Files to EXCLUDE from Upload:
- attached_assets/ folder (224MB - too large)
- node_modules/ folder (if exists)
- Any .mp4 or large media files
- Temporary files and backups

### Upload Strategy:
1. Upload core files first (25MB package)
2. Test deployment on Vercel
3. Add additional features later if needed

This will get your complete MarketPace platform live without file size issues.

# Deployment Package Creator - MarketPace

## STATUS UPDATE:
✅ **Files Uploaded to GitHub**: admin-login.html and founder-brooke-brown.jpg (18 minutes ago)  
✅ **Founder Image Working**: Accessible at https://www.marketpace.shop/founder-brooke-brown.jpg  
❌ **Admin Login Issue**: Returns 404 (may need .html extension)  
❌ **Image Path Wrong**: Website still shows old `/attached_assets/` path instead of `/assets/`  

## CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS:

### 1. Admin Login Accessibility
- File exists in GitHub: `admin-login.html` 
- Try: https://www.marketpace.shop/admin-login.html (with .html extension)
- Issue may be routing configuration

### 2. Image Path Problem  
- Live site still displays: `/attached_assets/IMG_7976_1751900735722.jpeg`
- Should display: `/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`
- This suggests the GitHub deployment is still using old version of pitch-page.html

## SOLUTION NEEDED:
The updated pitch-page.html (with correct image path) needs to be uploaded to GitHub to replace the old version.

## FILES TO UPDATE IN GITHUB:
1. `pitch-page.html` - Update image path from `/attached_assets/` to `/assets/`
2. `pitch-page.js` - Update static file serving path 

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Admin login accessible (with/without .html)
- [ ] Founder image displays correctly on pitch page
- [ ] No broken image placeholders
- [ ] All image paths use `/assets/` folder

The core files are uploaded but the HTML files with updated paths need to be synchronized.

# FINAL GITHUB SOLUTION - LOGO FILE MISSING

## CURRENT STATUS:
✅ **Founder image:** Working perfectly (HTTP 200)
✅ **HTML paths:** All corrected (no leading slashes)  
✅ **Vercel deployment:** Active and functional
❌ **Logo file:** Missing from GitHub repository

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` file is not in the GitHub repository. The GitHub API shows no logo file exists.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:
**You need to upload the logo file again to GitHub**

### Step-by-Step Fix:
1. **Find the logo file on your computer**
   - Look for `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` in your downloads or MarketPace folder
   - If you can't find it, download it from the Replit workspace

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (exact filename, no parentheses)
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy
   - Check https://www.marketpace.shop - logo should appear

## ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
If you can't find the original logo file, I can help you download it from the Replit workspace and provide instructions for upload.

## EXPECTED FINAL RESULT:
✅ Logo displays on homepage
✅ Founder image displays (already working)
✅ Zero 404 errors
✅ Complete live site functionality

**STATUS:** One file upload away from complete success!

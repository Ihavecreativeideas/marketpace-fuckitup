# FINAL SOLUTION: GitHub File Update

## The Problem
Your file update didn't actually save to GitHub, which is why Vercel isn't updating.

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Access GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp

### 2. Find the Pitch Page File
Look for: pitch-page.html in the file listing

### 3. Edit the File
- Click on pitch-page.html
- Click the pencil icon (Edit)
- Select ALL content (Ctrl+A)
- Delete everything
- Paste the cyan theme content from CYAN_THEME_PITCH_PAGE.html

### 4. Commit Properly
- Scroll to bottom
- Add commit message: "Apply cyan futuristic theme to pitch page"
- Click "Commit changes"

### 5. Verify Update
- Refresh the file page
- Check if content shows cyan styling code
- Look for #00FFFF color codes in the file

### 6. Force Vercel Redeploy
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Find MarketPace project
- Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

## Expected Result:
www.marketpace.shop will show cyan theme within 2-3 minutes

## If GitHub Repository Doesn't Exist:
The repository might be private or the URL might be different.
In that case, provide the correct GitHub URL for assistance.

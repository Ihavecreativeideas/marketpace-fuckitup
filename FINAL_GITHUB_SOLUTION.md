# Final GitHub Upload Solution

## Current Status:
‚úÖ **Founder Image**: WORKING (HTTP 200)
üîÑ **Logo**: Smaller version ready for upload (much better file size)

## Solution Applied:
‚úÖ **Smaller Logo File**: User provided optimized version (much smaller than 10.4MB)
‚úÖ **File Ready**: Copied to correct filename `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg`
‚úÖ **Upload Ready**: File size should work with GitHub web interface

## Troubleshooting Steps:

### Step 1: Verify Upload on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Look for `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` in the file list
3. Check if it's actually there with the correct name

### Step 2: Check File Size Limits
- GitHub has file size limits for web uploads
- 10.4MB might be too large
- Consider using a compressed version

### Step 3: Alternative Logo Files
Check if you have these files available:
- marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg
- Any smaller logo versions

### Step 4: Direct Upload Method
If the file isn't showing in GitHub:
1. Try uploading again
2. Wait for full upload completion
3. Check for any error messages

## Expected Timeline:
- GitHub upload: Immediate if successful
- Vercel deployment: 2-3 minutes
- Cache clearing: Up to 5 minutes

## Status Summary:
- ‚úÖ Founder image: FIXED AND WORKING
- ‚ùå Logo: Needs successful upload to GitHub
- ‚úÖ HTML paths: Corrected and deployed

The founder image fix was successful. The logo just needs a successful upload to complete the fixes.

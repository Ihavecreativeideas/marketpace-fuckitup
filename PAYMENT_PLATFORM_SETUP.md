}
```

## How Driver Payments Work

### 1. Route Completion Payment Flow
1. **Driver completes delivery route** → Triggers payment calculation
2. **System calculates earnings**:
   - Pickups: Number of pickups × $4.00
   - Dropoffs: Number of dropoffs × $2.00  
   - Mileage: Total miles × $0.50
   - Large items: +$25.00 if truck/van delivery
   - Tips: 100% passed through to driver
3. **Stripe processes payment** → Instant transfer to driver's bank account

### 2. Payment Processing (via Stripe)
- **Platform**: Stripe Connect for marketplace payments
- **Timing**: Immediate payment upon route completion
- **Method**: Direct bank transfer to driver's account
- **Fees**: Platform handles all payment processing fees

### 3. Driver Onboarding Payment Setup
When drivers apply via `/driver-application.html`:
1. **Document verification** (license, insurance, background check)
2. **Stripe Connect account creation** (bank details, tax info)
3. **Payment method verification**
4. **Approval** → Driver can start earning

# MarketPace Security Audit Report

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Exposed Sensitive Credentials** - CRITICAL
- `.env` file contains exposed API keys and secrets
- Twilio, Google OAuth, Facebook OAuth, and Shopify credentials are visible
- Database credentials exposed

### 2. **Input Validation Vulnerabilities** - HIGH
- No input sanitization on integration routes
- SQL injection potential in user-generated content
- XSS vulnerability in HTML content rendering

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization Issues** - HIGH
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Missing session validation on sensitive operations
- No CSRF protection implementation

### 4. **API Security Gaps** - MEDIUM
- Missing API key validation on external integrations
- No request throttling for expensive operations
- Insufficient error handling revealing system information

### 5. **Content Security Policy Weaknesses** - MEDIUM
- `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` used in CSP
- Overly permissive script execution policies

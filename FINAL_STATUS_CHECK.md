# FINAL STATUS CHECK - July 17, 2025

## CURRENT STATUS:
✅ **Logo File**: HTTP 200 - marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg serving properly
✅ **Logo Display**: Confirmed visible on live site
⏳ **Logo Size**: Checking if 80px update deployed...

## VERIFICATION NEEDED:
1. Visit https://www.marketpace.shop/community.html
2. Check if logo is properly sized (should be larger than before)
3. Confirm all navigation works
4. Test admin login (admin/admin)

## IF LOGO STILL SMALL:
- The community.html update may not have deployed yet
- Give Vercel 1-2 minutes to sync the file
- Or manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard

## EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
- Large, visible logo
- Working admin login  
- Functional navigation
- All 3 critical issues resolved

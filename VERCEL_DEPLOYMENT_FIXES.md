# Vercel Deployment Issue Resolution

## Root Cause Analysis

The cyan theme isn't deploying because of one of these issues:

### 1. GitHub Repository Access Problem
- Repository might not exist or be inaccessible
- File `pitch-page.html` might not exist in GitHub
- Previous update attempts failed to save to GitHub

### 2. Vercel Configuration Issue
- Vercel might be deploying from wrong branch
- Build configuration might be incorrect
- Cache issues despite redeploy attempts

### 3. File Path Mismatch
- Vercel might be looking for `index.html` instead of `pitch-page.html`
- Root directory configuration might be wrong

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Check if repository exists and is accessible
3. Look for `pitch-page.html` file in root directory
4. Check if file contains cyan theme code with #00FFFF colors

### Step 2: Check Vercel Configuration
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → General
2. Verify "Root Directory" setting
3. Check "Output Directory" configuration
4. Ensure correct GitHub repository is connected

### Step 3: Manual File Update
If GitHub repository exists:
1. Edit `pitch-page.html` directly in GitHub
2. Replace entire content with cyan theme code
3. Commit changes with clear message
4. Trigger Vercel redeploy

## Solutions

### Solution A: Direct GitHub Edit
1. Access GitHub repository
2. Edit pitch-page.html file
3. Replace content with cyan theme
4. Save and commit changes

### Solution B: Vercel Manual Upload
1. Download cyan theme file from workspace
2. Upload directly to Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy manually without GitHub

### Solution C: Repository Recreation
If repository doesn't exist:
1. Create new GitHub repository
2. Upload all MarketPace files
3. Connect to Vercel
4. Deploy with cyan theme

## Expected Outcomes

After successful fix:
- Site loads with cyan color scheme (#00FFFF)

# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIXES - GitHub Upload Required

## PROBLEM:
Your Vercel site (www.marketpace.shop) has old file versions from GitHub. All fixes are complete in Replit but need to be uploaded to GitHub to deploy to Vercel.

## CRITICAL FILES TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB:

### 1. **pitch-page.html** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Fixes Applied:**
- Sign Up/Login button: `/signup-login` → `/signup-login.html`
- Founder image path: `/attached_assets/IMG_7976...` → `/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`

### 2. **signup-login.html** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Fixes Applied:**
- All community redirects: `/community` → `/community.html` (12 locations)
- Authentication flow properly directs to community page

### 3. **admin-login.html** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Working in Replit with admin/admin credentials
**Need:** Upload current version to ensure admin access works on Vercel

### 4. **admin-dashboard.html** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** Full dashboard with AI assistant functional
**Need:** Upload to ensure admin functionality works on Vercel

### 5. **assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** Image file exists in Replit assets folder
**Need:** Upload to GitHub assets folder for proper image display

## VERIFICATION AFTER GITHUB UPLOAD:

Test these URLs on www.marketpace.shop:

1. **Main Page**: Click "Sign Up / Login" → Should reach signup page (no 404)
2. **Signup Flow**: Complete Facebook/Google login → Should reach community page
3. **Admin Access**: Visit /admin-login.html → Should accept admin/admin credentials
4. **Founder Image**: Should display in founder story section
5. **Dashboard**: Admin dashboard should load with full functionality

## GITHUB UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Upload `pitch-page.html` (replaces old version)
2. Upload `signup-login.html` (replaces old version)  
3. Upload `admin-login.html` (ensures admin access)
4. Upload `admin-dashboard.html` (ensures dashboard works)
5. Upload `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (founder image)

## RESULT AFTER UPLOAD:
- ✅ Member signup/login will work
- ✅ Admin dashboard access will work  
- ✅ Founder image will display
- ✅ Complete authentication flow functional
- ✅ Vercel deployment will be 100% operational

**These 5 files will fix all issues on your Vercel deployment.**

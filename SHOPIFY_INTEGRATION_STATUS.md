# Shopify Integration Status Report

## Current Status: ❌ AUTHENTICATION ERROR

### Connection Test Results
- **Store Domain**: myshop-marketpace-com.myshopify.com ✅
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints accessible ✅
- **Access Token**: Invalid or expired ❌

### Error Details
```
HTTP 401: [API] Invalid API key or access token (unrecognized login or wrong password)
```

### What's Working
✅ Shopify integration routes are registered and functional
✅ Store domain is correctly configured
✅ API endpoints are reachable (no network issues)
✅ Business integration interface exists at `/shopify-business-integration`
✅ All integration logic is implemented and ready

### What Needs To Be Fixed
❌ **Access Token Issue**: Your current Shopify access token has expired or is invalid
❌ **API Authentication**: Need to regenerate private app access token

## How to Fix Your Shopify Integration

### Step 1: Generate New Access Token
1. Go to your Shopify Admin: https://myshop-marketpace-com.myshopify.com/admin
2. Navigate to **Settings > Apps and sales channels**
3. Click **Develop apps**
4. Find your MarketPace app or create a new one
5. Go to **API credentials** tab
6. Generate a new **Admin API access token**

### Step 2: Required API Permissions
Ensure your private app has these scopes:
- `read_products` (to sync products)
- `write_products` (to update products)
- `read_orders` (to track orders)
- `read_locations` (for store info)
- `read_inventory` (for stock levels)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
Once you have the new token, update:
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` = your new token (starts with `shpat_`)
- `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` = myshop-marketpace-com.myshopify.com

## Available Features (Once Fixed)
- ✅ **Product Sync**: Import all Shopify products to MarketPace
- ✅ **Local Delivery**: Add MarketPace delivery to Shopify products
- ✅ **Pricing Control**: Set custom delivery fees and processing fees
- ✅ **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock synchronization
- ✅ **Order Tracking**: Sync orders between platforms
- ✅ **Business Dashboard**: Manage synced products and promotions

## Test Commands
After fixing the token, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/shopify/test-connection
```

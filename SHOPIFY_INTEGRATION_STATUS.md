### What Needs To Be Fixed
❌ **Merchant Approval**: Your private app needs merchant approval for API scopes
❌ **API Permissions**: Missing approval for `read_products` and `read_locations` scopes

## How to Fix Your Shopify Integration

### Step 1: Approve Your Private App
1. Go to your Shopify Admin: https://myshop-marketpace-com.myshopify.com/admin
2. Navigate to **Settings > Apps and sales channels**
3. Click **Develop apps**
4. Find your MarketPace app
5. Click **Review and approve** or **Approve app**
6. Grant permissions for required scopes

### Step 2: Required API Permissions (Grant These)
- `read_products` (to sync products)
- `write_products` (to update products)
- `read_orders` (to track orders)
- `read_locations` (for store info)
- `read_inventory` (for stock levels)

### Step 3: Verify App Status
After approval, your app should show as "Approved" in the Shopify Admin

## Available Features (Once Fixed)
- ✅ **Product Sync**: Import all Shopify products to MarketPace
- ✅ **Local Delivery**: Add MarketPace delivery to Shopify products
- ✅ **Pricing Control**: Set custom delivery fees and processing fees
- ✅ **Inventory Management**: Real-time stock synchronization

# Logo Upload Solution

## Current Status:
✅ **Founder Image**: WORKING! (HTTP 200) - Fixed by correcting path
❌ **Logo**: NOT WORKING (HTTP 404) - File upload issue

## Problem with Logo:
The marketpace-logo-1.jpeg file is 10.4MB, which may be too large for GitHub's web interface upload limits.

## Solution: Re-upload Logo File

### Method 1: Direct Upload (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files" 
3. Drag ONLY the marketpace-logo-1.jpeg file
4. Wait for upload to complete (may take time due to size)
5. Commit with message: "Re-upload logo file"

### Method 2: Check if File Already Exists
The file might be uploaded but with a different name. Check your repository for:
- marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
- marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg
- Any other logo files

### Method 3: Use Smaller Logo
If upload keeps failing due to file size:
1. The file is 10.4MB which is large
2. Consider using a compressed version
3. GitHub has file size limits for web uploads

## Expected Result:
After successful upload, the logo should display on the homepage.

## Current Working Status:
- ✅ Founder image: FIXED and working
- ❌ Logo: Needs re-upload

The founder image fix was successful! Now just need to resolve the logo upload issue.

# EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG AND WHAT TO UPLOAD

## THE REAL PROBLEM:
- Live site HTML files look for: `marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg`
- GitHub has: NOTHING (both logo files were deleted)
- Result: 404 because NO logo file exists in GitHub

## WHAT TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB:
1. `marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg` (35KB) - REQUIRED for logo to display
2. `admin-login.html` - For admin login fix

## WHAT NOT TO UPLOAD:
- pitch-page.html (already has correct optimized path)
- community.html (already has correct optimized path)

## UPLOAD STEPS:
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Upload ONLY these 2 files:
   - marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg 
   - admin-login.html
3. Commit message: "Add missing optimized logo and fix admin login"

## RESULT:
✅ Logo displays (optimized version)
✅ Admin login works
✅ Navigation already works

**Upload 2 files. Done.**

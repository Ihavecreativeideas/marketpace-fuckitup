# Vercel Security Checkpoint Fix

## Issue: "We're verifying your browser" Message

Your site is showing a security checkpoint despite firewall being disabled. This is likely caused by:

1. **DDoS Protection** - Automatic security triggered by traffic
2. **Edge Config Security** - Additional Vercel protection layer
3. **Build Logs Protection** - Restricting site access

## Solutions to Try:

### Option 1: Disable Additional Security Features
In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Security:
1. Look for "DDoS Protection" - Turn OFF
2. Check "Edge Config" - Disable if present
3. Find "Build Logs Protection" - Turn OFF
4. Save all changes

### Option 2: Check Project Settings
In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → General:
1. Verify "Framework Preset" is set to "Other" 
2. Check "Root Directory" is set to "/" or blank
3. Ensure "Output Directory" matches your setup

### Option 3: Temporary Access Bypass
1. Click "Website owner? Click here to fix" link on the security page
2. This should give you admin bypass options
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to whitelist your access

### Option 4: Force Public Access
In Project Settings → Functions:
1. Set "Deployment Protection" to OFF
2. Turn off "Password Protection" if enabled
3. Disable "Trusted IPs only" if present

## Expected Result:
Site should load normally showing either:
- Your new cyan theme (if GitHub update worked)
- Original design (if GitHub update failed)

## Next Steps After Access Restored:
1. Check if cyan theme is visible
2. If not, verify GitHub file was actually updated
3. Force another deployment if needed

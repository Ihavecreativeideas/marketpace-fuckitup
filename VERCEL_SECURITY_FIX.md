# VERCEL SECURITY SETTINGS FIX

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your Vercel security settings are blocking public access to your website. The following settings are causing the security checkpoint:

1. **Build Logs and Source Protection: ENABLED** ❌
2. **Git Fork Protection: ENABLED** ❌
3. **OIDC Federation: ENABLED** ❌

These settings are designed for private/internal projects, not public websites.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

### Step 1: Disable Security Features (in Vercel Dashboard)
1. Go to Project Settings → Security
2. **DISABLE "Build Logs and Source Protection"**
3. **DISABLE "Git Fork Protection"** 
4. **DISABLE "OIDC Federation"** (unless needed for backend)

### Step 2: Add vercel.json Configuration
I've created a `vercel.json` file that:
- Explicitly configures static file serving
- Sets up proper routing
- Ensures public access

Upload this `vercel.json` file to your GitHub repository root.

### Step 3: Redeploy
After uploading vercel.json and disabling security features:
1. Trigger a new deployment (commit any small change)
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Test your site

## EXPECTED RESULT:
- www.marketpace.shop will load normally
- No more security checkpoint
- All pages accessible to public visitors
- Sign Up/Login button will work
- Admin dashboard accessible
- Founder image will display

## SECURITY NOTE:
These settings were blocking ALL public access. For a public marketplace website, you want:
- ✅ Public access enabled
- ✅ Static file serving
- ❌ No authentication requirements for viewing

The security checkpoint was protecting your site FROM your own users!

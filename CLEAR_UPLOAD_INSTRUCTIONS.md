# EXACTLY WHAT TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB

## THE SITUATION:
- Your HTML files look for: `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg`
- GitHub currently has: `marketpace-logo-optimized.jpeg` 
- Result: 404 error because file names don't match

## THE FIX:
Upload the missing `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` file to GitHub (keep both files)

## UPLOAD TO GITHUB:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Upload these 4 files:
   - `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (the 4.6MB file your HTML is looking for)
   - `pitch-page.html` 
   - `community.html`
   - `admin-login.html`

## RESULT:
- Logo will display (HTML finds the file it's looking for)
- Admin login will work
- Community navigation will work

**Don't delete the optimized logo - just add the missing original file!**

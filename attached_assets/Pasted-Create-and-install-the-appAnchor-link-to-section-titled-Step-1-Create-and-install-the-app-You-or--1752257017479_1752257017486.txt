You or the user can create and install a custom app in the Shopify admin by following the Custom apps documentation on the Shopify Help Center.

Step 2: Make authenticated requestsAnchor link to section titled "Step 2: Make authenticated requests"

Rotating API credentials or generating new access tokens for admin-created appsAnchor link to section titled "Rotating API credentials or generating new access tokens for admin-created apps"
You can't rotate API credentials for custom apps created in the Shopify admin. You need to delete the app and create a new custom app which will have new API credentials.

To create new access tokens for a custom app that was created in the Shopify admin, you need to uninstall and reinstall your app.

Caution
Your app's requests and webhooks will be disrupted until you update your app's code with the new API credentials or access token.

If you want to rotate access tokens for a custom storefront that you build with the Headless channel, refer to the documentation on rotating private access tokens in the Shopify admin.

Changing API scopesAnchor link to section titled "Changing API scopes"
Anyone with a staff or collaborator account on a store can change what store resources an admin-created custom app can access, but only if they have all the following permissions:

the Manage and install apps and channels permission and the Develop apps permission
the relevant permissions for the respective store resource
For example, if a staff or collaborator account has the View or manage products, variants, and collections permission for the store, then they can only change API scopes related to the store's products, variants, and collections.

The store owner can change the permissions for a staff or collaborator account in the Shopify admin.

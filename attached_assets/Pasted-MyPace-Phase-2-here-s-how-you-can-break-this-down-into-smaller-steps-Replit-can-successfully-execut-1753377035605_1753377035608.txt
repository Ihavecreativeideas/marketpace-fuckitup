MyPace Phase 2, here's how you can break this down into smaller steps Replit can successfully execute without getting stuck.

✅ What Replit Agent Is Likely Getting Stuck On
The file_text parameter is required when using create commands to generate HTML or code files — and if the page is too long or complex, Replit's agent may get overwhelmed.

To avoid that, let’s chunk Phase 2 into smaller steps.

🔧 Let’s Walk Through the Build Steps One at a Time
✅ Step 1: Replit Builds a New Page Template (MyPace v2)
Ask Replit:

Create a file named mypace.html that includes:

A header with logo, calendar icon, and map icon (same as community.html)

A section with a "Check In Now" button

A reddish-purple theme

A placeholder div called checkin-feed for check-ins

A floating map button

Then let them confirm the file was successfully created.

✅ Step 2: Add Geo Location Script
Once the page shell exists, ask:

Add the following geolocation script to mypace.html in a <script> tag at the bottom:

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => {
    const lat = position.coords.latitude;
    const lon = position.coords.longitude;
    console.log("User is here:", lat, lon);
    // TODO: Query Supabase for nearby check-in spots
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error("Geolocation error:", error);
  }
);
This lets you verify geolocation is working before connecting Supabase.

✅ Step 3: Build “Create Check-In” Modal
Add a modal (hidden by default) that includes:

Upload photo input

Optional caption

Dropdown for “In support of [Artist/Vendor]”

Submit button

Rating bar (1–5 stars)

Optional review textarea

Ask Replit:

Add a modal with:

html
Copy
Edit
<input type="file" accept="image/*">
<input type="text" placeholder="Caption">
<select><option value="">In support of...</option></select>
<textarea placeholder="Leave a review..."></textarea>
<button>Submit Check-In</button>
✅ Step 4: Add Public Check-In Feed
Ask Replit:

Add a scrollable section under the map called #checkin-feed. This will later be used to show all recent check-ins from Supabase.

You can preload this with dummy cards like:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="checkin-card">
  <p><strong>@brooke checked in at Joe’s Coffee</strong></p>
  <p>“Best latte in town!” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
  <img src="checkin1.jpg">
</div>
✅ Step 5: Connect to Supabase
This is the moment for Supabase database table creation:

checkins (user_id, location_name, lat, lon, photo_url, support_tag, review, rating)

geo_codes (place_name, created_by, lat, lon, description, type)

Ask Replit:

Connect Supabase and create two tables: checkins and geo_codes. Each check-in will post the user's current location, image URL, caption, rating, etc.

✅ Step 6: Add Map Radar Button
Add a floating icon button (like Google Maps pin). When tapped:

Opens modal with Leaflet.js map

Shows user’s location and pins from geo_codes

Ask Replit:

Add a Leaflet.js map button in the bottom corner. When tapped, it opens a modal with the user’s location + any nearby geo QR pins from geo_codes.

✅ Step 7: Add Integration to Profile Page
Ask Replit:

On the member profile page, create a new section called “📍 Places I’ve Paced” that displays the last 10 check-ins for that user with a small map, timestamp, and support tag.

✅ Optional Later Step: Facebook Sharing + Invite Button
Ask Replit:

Add a “Share this check-in” button to each post that opens Facebook’s sharing dialog with the image, location, and caption.

✅ Summary Instructions to Tell Replit
Let’s pause and build each piece of Phase 2 one step at a time. Please start with:

Creating the mypace.html page with reddish-purple theme

Include header with logo, calendar, and map icons

Add a “Check In” button and #checkin-feed container

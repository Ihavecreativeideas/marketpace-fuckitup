 Meet the Founder
Hi, I’m Brooke — the founder of MarketPace.

I built this app because I was tired of watching people pour their time, money, and creativity into platforms that don’t give anything back. Social media became a loop — a scroll of likes and algorithms — but no real-life connection, no support where it actually matters.

I wanted to build something that puts real people first. Something rooted in real-world support — where showing up for someone’s small business, event, or hustle isn’t just a “like”… it’s a check-in, a purchase, a moment shared IRL.

Why MarketPace?
MarketPace is more than an app. It’s a movement.
It’s where your local coffee shop, your cousin’s food truck, your friend’s pop-up art show — they all live, grow, and get supported.
It’s where your community is mapped, celebrated, and mobilized.
It’s where being present in your city, your neighborhood, your block — actually means something.

I built this for us. For the people who are doing it for themselves, for the small businesses trying to compete in an online world, for the artists, the vendors, the entertainers — and the neighbors who want to support them.

What makes us different?
Other platforms were built for global clicks.
MarketPace was built for local action.

You don’t need followers here — you need your community.

We’re not tracking how long you scroll — we care where you show up.

Our app rewards check-ins, not clout.

We celebrate small businesses, not big advertisers.

We’ve added real tools for real people — booking, scheduling, rentals, deliveries, check-ins, community maps, artist hubs, vendor lists, event pages, and more. And we’re doing it without selling your data or feeding into the noise.

My Pledge to You:
I promise to keep this platform rooted in realness — not hype.
I promise to listen to our users and improve with intention.
I promise to keep MarketPace human-first, community-driven, and creator-respecting.
And I promise this:
This will be the app that matters. The one that makes a difference — not just online, but in your actual life.

Let’s build stronger communities together. One check-in at a time.

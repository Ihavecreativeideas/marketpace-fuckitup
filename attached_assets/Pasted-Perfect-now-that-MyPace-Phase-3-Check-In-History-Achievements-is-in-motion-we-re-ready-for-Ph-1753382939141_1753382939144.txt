Perfect — now that MyPace Phase 3 (Check-In History + Achievements) is in motion, we’re ready for Phase 4, which will bring the social interactions + public discovery + loyalty rewards system to life.

This phase adds real networking, support tracking, business visibility, and event discovery.

✅ MyPace Phase 4: Community Discovery + Loyalty + Public Profile Interaction
Let’s break this down clearly for Replit, step-by-step, with clear tasks that won’t overload the agent:

🧩 Step 1: Public MyPace Feed (Discovery Page)
✅ Create a public-facing version of the check-in feed (like a local “storyline” of real activity in the community).

New File: mypace-discover.html
Layout:

Use same header/footer as mypace.html

Centered feed showing check-ins from all users (like a public wall)

Filter: Nearby, This Week, Popular, By Tag

Each check-in should show:

Username (clickable to their public page)

Profile photo

Location + time of check-in

Optional message or support tag (e.g. “Here to support @djNova”)

Heart button ❤️ (social interaction)

Comment button 💬 (open reply field)

🔌 Backend:

New route: /api/mypace/discover-feed

Use pagination (load 10 at a time, infinite scroll or “Load more”)

💼 Step 2: Loyalty Badge System for Businesses
✅ Reward local businesses, entertainers, and venues who have the most support.

New Table: support_checkins
Fields: memberId, businessId, eventId, timestamp, supportTag

Trigger: When a member checks in and tags support for a business or artist.

Badge Examples for Businesses:

💎 “10 Check-Ins Club”

🏅 “Fan Favorite Venue”

📈 “Most Loved This Week”

🔌 Backend API:

/api/business/:id/support-insights

/api/entertainment/:id/supporters

🧭 Step 3: Radar Map View for Check-Ins
✅ Show a live map of nearby Geo QR Check-Ins with clickable pins

Use Case: Like Pokémon GO — members can pull up a radar and explore nearby locations.

New Page: mypace-radar.html

Integrate Google Maps or Leaflet.js

Pull live pins from: /api/geo/checkins?lat=__&lng=__

Pins = real check-in activity

Click pin → see who’s there, support tag, and photo

🔌 Backend API needed:

/api/geo/checkins

🧷 Step 4: Business & Artist Pages Show Support Stats
When visiting any public page of:

A business

An artist (entertainment profile)

A vendor

You should see:

Number of unique supporters (based on check-ins)

Their recent supporters (top 5 with avatars)

Support leaderboard

📲 Step 5: Social Invites + Sharing
✅ Invite people to events or shops using social sharing tools.

Add to mypace.html:

Facebook share button for your own check-in

“Invite a friend” modal (email or Facebook friend)

“Support with me” badge (lets others click to also support that business)

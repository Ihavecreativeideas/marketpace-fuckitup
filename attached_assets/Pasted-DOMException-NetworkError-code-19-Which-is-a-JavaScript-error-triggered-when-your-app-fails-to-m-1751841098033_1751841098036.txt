DOMException: NetworkError (code 19)

Which is a JavaScript error triggered when your app fails to make a network request — for example, a fetch() or axios() call to an API or resource fails before even receiving a response.

✅ Here's how to resolve it — step by step:
🔍 Step 1: Identify What Triggered the Error
In your browser:

Open DevTools → Console + Network tab

Refresh the page

Look for any red X requests in Network tab

Click it → check:

URL requested

Status code (e.g., 404, 403, 500)

CORS errors in headers

Mixed content? (HTTP call from an HTTPS site)

⚠️ Common Causes + Fixes
1. ❌ Bad API URL or Server is Down
js
Copy
Edit
fetch("https://your-api-url.com/data")
✅ Fix: Make sure the API:

URL is correct

Server is online

Route /data exists

2. ❌ CORS Error (Cross-Origin Request Blocked)
If your frontend and backend are on different domains, the server must allow your origin.

✅ Fix on Backend:

js
Copy
Edit
// Express.js example
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); // or your frontend domain
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  next();
});
3. ❌ HTTP to HTTPS Mismatch
Browsers block HTTP calls from secure (HTTPS) websites.

✅ Fix:

Use https:// URLs only if your frontend is HTTPS

Or run everything on localhost during testing

4. ❌ Requesting Camera/Mic Without HTTPS
If you’re using getUserMedia():

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
…it will fail outside of localhost unless served over https://.

✅ Fix: Run on:

localhost

or real domain with SSL (https)

5. ❌ Trying to Use Service Worker or IndexedDB During Navigation
If this happens while registering service workers or background sync, it might be a context issue.

✅ Fix: Wrap logic in a check:

js
Copy
Edit
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(...)
    .catch(err => console.error("SW error:", err));
}
🧪 Add Catch to Trace It
Wrap your code to isolate the issue:

js
Copy
Edit
try {
  const response = await fetch("https://your-api-url.com/data");
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);
  const data = await response.json();
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Network error caught:", err.message);
}

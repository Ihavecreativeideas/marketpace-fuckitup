🔥 Awesome — let’s move to Phase 5: Live Events, Schedules & Map Check-Ins
This phase introduces event scheduling, real-time location-based experiences, and map radar check-ins — turning MyPace into a true local movement hub.

✅ Phase 5: Live Events, Schedules & Map Check-Ins
🎯 Goal:
Let members create events with schedules + locations, and let others check in live, view entertainers/vendors at those events, and see it all on a map-based radar feed.

🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown for Replit Agent
✅ Step 1: Create Event Creation Form
New Page: /create-event.html

Form Fields:

📍 Event Title

📅 Date/Time (start + end)

📌 Location (auto + manual input — pulls coordinates)

🎟️ Event Type (Music, Market, Festival, Food Truck, etc.)

🎤 Add Participants (Artists, Vendors, Staff, Volunteers — with support tags)

🧾 Optional: Upload flyer image

🔗 Optional: Add website or ticketing link

On Submit:

Save to /api/mypace/events

Return event ID and generate Geo QR Code

✅ Step 2: QR Code Generation & Storage
On event creation, system automatically creates a Geo QR code

Stores: eventID, lat, long, timestamp, and event title

Save QR Code to event object in database

Users can print/download

✅ Step 3: Add Events to Radar Map
Update: /mypace-map.html

Pull live data from /api/mypace/events/active

Display map pins for events within 25 miles

Clicking a pin shows:

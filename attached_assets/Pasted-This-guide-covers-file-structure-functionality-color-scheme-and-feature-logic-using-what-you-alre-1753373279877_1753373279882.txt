✅ MyPace Page: Full Implementation Guide for Replit
🧭 Page Purpose
“MyPace” is a real-world check-in feed powered by Geo QR Codes. It’s not about followers—it’s about showing up. Think Pokémon Go meets Foursquare meets local loyalty.

🔨 1. PAGE CREATION
➤ File Name:
mypace.html (or mypace.tsx if using React TypeScript structure)

➤ Location:
Put this inside your client/src/pages/ or wherever community.html lives.

🎨 2. DESIGN STRUCTURE
Replicate the layout of community.html but modify for:

Theme Color: Reddish-purple accent (#8A2BE2 or similar)

Icons: Replace emoji with custom futuristic icons

Header: Same layout (Logo | Calendar | Map)

Footer Nav: Add MyPace between Local Pace and The Hub

🧱 3. HTML STRUCTURE
html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Floating Header -->
<div class="floating-header">
  <img src="/assets/logo.png" class="logo" />
  <div class="header-icons">
    <img src="/assets/calendar.svg" />
    <img src="/assets/map.svg" />
  </div>
</div>

<!-- MyPace Main Section -->
<section id="mypace-checkins">
  <h2 class="title">MyPace</h2>
  
  <button id="checkin-btn" class="checkin-button">📍 Check In Now</button>

  <div class="checkin-feed">
    <!-- Dynamically load member check-ins here -->
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Floating Navigation Bar -->
<div class="nav-container">
  <a href="/community.html">Local Pace</a>
  <a href="/market.html">Market</a>
  <a href="/mypace.html" class="active">MyPace</a>
  <a href="/micpace.html">The Hub</a>
  <a href="/menu.html">Menu</a>
</div>
⚙️ 4. FUNCTIONALITY (Step by Step)
✅ A. Geo QR Code Integration
When Check In Now is pressed:

Use HTML5 Geolocation API to get coordinates

Check if a Geo QR Code has been registered for this location

If exists → display list of shops, musicians, services, food trucks tied to it

If NOT → let member create a Geo QR Code (description, category, artist/business, tags)

✅ B. Photo Upload (with Geo verification)
Allow member to upload 1 photo during check-in

Use metadata or camera permissions to validate that it’s taken at the current location

✅ C. “I’m here to support ___” Field
Optional dropdown or text to select:

Artist

Business

Festival

Event

Community Group

✅ D. Post-Check-In Submission
js
Copy
Edit
{
  locationName: "The Red Barn",
  coordinates: [34.101, -89.340],
  checkedInBy: "Brooke",
  supporting: "The Whiskey Sisters",
  photoURL: "/checkin/brooke-photo-123.jpeg",
  time: "7:42pm",
  likes: 12,
  comments: [],
}
Store this in Supabase (or your DB) → show in live feed.

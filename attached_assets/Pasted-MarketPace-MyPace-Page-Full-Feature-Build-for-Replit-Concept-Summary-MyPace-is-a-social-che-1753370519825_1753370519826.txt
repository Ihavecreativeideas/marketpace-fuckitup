MarketPace: “MyPace” Page — Full Feature Build for Replit
🧠 Concept Summary:
MyPace is a social check-in hub powered by Geo QR Codes, designed to celebrate real-world presence instead of just online engagement. It is not about followers — it’s about supporters who show up.

Think Pokémon GO + Foursquare + Instagram + Yelp + event loyalty system — but for your local community.

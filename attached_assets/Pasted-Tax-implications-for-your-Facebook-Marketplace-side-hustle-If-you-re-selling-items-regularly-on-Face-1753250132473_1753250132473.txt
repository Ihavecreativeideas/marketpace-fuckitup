Tax implications for your Facebook Marketplace side hustle
If you're selling items regularly on Facebook Marketplace as a side hustle, you'll need to report your income and may be able to deduct eligible business expenses to reduce your taxable income. 
Here's a breakdown of the key considerations:
1. Differentiating between a business and a hobby
The IRS has specific criteria for distinguishing between a business and a hobby for tax purposes. 
Business: You are considered a business if you engage in the activity with the intent to make a profit and put forth regular, ongoing efforts to generate income.
Hobby: A hobby is primarily for personal enjoyment, even if you occasionally make money from it. 
2. Reporting income and self-employment taxes
Reporting Income: If your Facebook Marketplace activity is considered a business, you must report all income earned, even if you don't receive a Form 1099-K.
Self-Employment Tax: If your net earnings (gross income minus business expenses) from your Facebook Marketplace selling side hustle are $400 or more, you'll likely need to pay self-employment tax, which covers Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Schedule C & SE: You'll typically use Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) to report your business income and expenses. You'll then use Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax) to calculate and report your self-employment tax liability.
Estimated Taxes: If you anticipate owing $1,000 or more in taxes for the year (including income tax and self-employment tax), the IRS may require you to pay estimated taxes quarterly using Form 1040-ES. 
3. Potential tax deductions (write-offs)
You can deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses to reduce your taxable income. Some common deductions for online sellers include: 
Home office expenses: If you use a portion of your home exclusively and regularly for your Facebook Marketplace business, you may be able to deduct a portion of your home expenses, like rent, mortgage interest, utilities, and homeowners insurance. You can use the simplified method (deducting $5 per square foot, up to 300 square feet) or the actual expenses method, according to Bench Accounting.
Business supplies and equipment: Notebooks, pens, computers, software, and other items used for your business can be deducted.
Internet and phone expenses: You can deduct the percentage of your internet and phone bills attributable to your business use.
Vehicle expenses and mileage: If you use your car for business purposes, such as dropping off packages or meeting with suppliers, you can deduct the related expenses. You can use the standard mileage rate or deduct actual expenses (gas, maintenance, etc.).
Shipping and packaging costs: Expenses for postage, packing materials, and shipping services are deductible.
Marketing and advertising costs: Costs associated with promoting your products on Facebook or other platforms can be deducted.
Facebook Marketplace fees: The fees you pay to sell on Facebook Marketplace are deductible. 
4. Record keeping
Maintain accurate and organized records: Keep receipts, invoices, and other documentation for all your business income and expenses.
Tracking tools: Consider using spreadsheets or accounting software like QuickBooks, FreshBooks, or Xero to manage your finances.
Separate personal and business finances: Using a dedicated bank account and credit card for your side hustle helps maintain clear financial records. 
Note: The IRS carefully scrutinizes the home office deduction. It's a good practice to take photos of your dedicated workspace and file them with your other tax records to demonstrate exclusive business use. 
It's highly recommended to consult with a tax professional or CPA for personalized advice regarding your specific situation and to ensure you are meeting all your tax obligations and maximizing eligible deductions.

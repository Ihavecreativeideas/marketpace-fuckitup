Maps JavaScript API Error Codes

If you find an error on Chrome JavaScript Console, Firefox Web Console or any other equivalent tools on your browsers, please see the table below to find explanations for the error codes.

The Maps JavaScript API returns both errors and warnings. An error indicates a severe issue which occurred while loading the Maps JavaScript API. Your page cannot load the API correctly, and the API will not work on that page. A warning is a supplemental message about the loading of the Maps JavaScript API. The warning describes the possible reasons for an error, or suggests potential issues in your code that loads the Maps JavaScript API. If you receive only warnings without any errors, the API will work correctly on that page. However, we recommend that you fix these potential issues as well.

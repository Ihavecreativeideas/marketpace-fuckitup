Founder’s Story – Why I Built MarketPace
For nine years, I poured my heart and soul into my music page. I released a full album, won a JMA for Song of the Year, and built a following of over 15,000 genuine fans—one post, one performance, one conversation at a time. It took hard work, consistent content, and thousands of dollars in paid ads just to stay in Facebook’s algorithm.
But over the last 4–5 years, everything changed.
The platform became flooded with money-driven agendas, clickbait, and triggering content designed to keep us in constant conflict. Fake AI accounts started to thrive while real artists and small businesses got buried. Genuine creativity was replaced with shallow trends, and meaningful connection gave way to algorithm warfare.
Then came the bots.
They began impersonating me, stealing my merch, and scamming fans with fake ticket links. Even with 15,000 followers, I couldn’t reach my own community. And just like that—my page was hacked. My years of work, gone. Facebook let the fake version of me spread graphic, harmful content under my name while I reported it over and over… with no action taken. They didn’t care. Because fake engagement still makes them money.
That was the final straw.
MarketPace represents everything I wish existed while 9 years of life spent building my music career was torn down by platform manipulation. It’s more than a response—it’s a solution. Built to protect creators, support local businesses, and uplift real people, MarketPace is about creating a safe, trusted space where we support each other, grow our local economies, and build jobs from the ground up.
This isn’t just a delivery app or marketplace—it’s a platform with purpose. A platform that actually serves its community. 
We’re flipping the script:
 Support Local over Likes.
 Build Community over Clicks.
 Choose Art over Algorithms.
 Claim Success over Scams.
We're raising the standard where you set the pace, and we make it happen…
So, if you're ready for something real —
 Get on my level. Welcome to MarketPace.
Sincerely, 
Brooke Brown- Founder, MarketPace

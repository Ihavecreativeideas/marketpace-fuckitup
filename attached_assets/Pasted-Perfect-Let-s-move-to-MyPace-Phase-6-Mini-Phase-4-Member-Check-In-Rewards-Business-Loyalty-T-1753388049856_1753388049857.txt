Perfect! Let’s move to 📍MyPace Phase 6: Mini-Phase 4 — Member Check-In Rewards & Business Loyalty Tools — this phase introduces real-world incentives and repeat-visit tools that make the platform addictive and useful for both businesses and members.

🧩 PHASE 6: MINI-PHASE 4 — REWARDS, LOYALTY & MEMBER INCENTIVES
🎯 Goal:
Reward members for showing up in real life, and give local businesses tools to drive repeat support and customer retention — not just vanity metrics.

✅ STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN FOR REPLIT:
1. Business Loyalty Card System
✅ Allow business profiles to activate a “Loyalty Rewards” program.

Admin dashboard toggle: “Enable Check-In Loyalty Card”

Set rewards like:

⭐️ "5 Check-Ins = Free Coffee"

🎁 "10 Visits = $5 Off Coupon"

Track each member’s progress using:

/api/mypace/loyalty/:user/:business

✅ Replit needs to build:

Loyalty tracking table

Progress counter display per user per business

Reward claim logic + redemption alert

2. Member Wallet (Rewards Center)
✅ Add a “Rewards” tab in MyPace profiles:

“You’ve earned ___”

Progress meters for each business

Buttons: Redeem, Visit Again, View Offer

Bonus: Integrate this with the existing check-in logic so no manual entry needed.

3. Geo-Based Rewards Pop-Ups
✅ When checking in:

If location matches a business with rewards,

Show pop-up: “You’ve earned 1 point at @Joey’s Pizza!”

API: /api/mypace/checkins/rewards + Geolocation match
Frontend: Use existing QR + location pull already working

4. Referral Incentives
✅ Each member gets a “Referral QR Code”

New sign-ups with that code = 1 free check-in point

Referral tracking visible on profile:

“You’ve invited 4 members”

“Earned 3 extra reward stamps”

API: /api/mypace/referrals/:username

5. Supporter Level Perks
✅ When members support businesses/artists repeatedly:

Auto-generate tags like:

💎 “Super Supporter”

🏆 “Top 10%”

🔥 “Weekly Regular”

Badges appear on profile + event rosters

Optional business setting to offer custom perks to top supporters

API: /api/mypace/supporter-rank

6. Shop and Event Owners Can Post Exclusive Offers
✅ Add toggle on event creation page:

“Offer Reward for Check-In?”

Upload flyer or coupon code

Shown only to those who check in at that location

7. Leaderboard Boosts
✅ Supporters gain extra points on leaderboard when:

They redeem a loyalty reward

Refer a friend who checks in

🎁 OPTIONAL BONUSES (Nice-to-Haves)
“Spin the Wheel” on 10th visit (fun random reward)

Weekly Challenges: “Support 3 shops this week to earn bonus badge”

Secret Spot Rewards: “Check in to hidden landmarks for XP”

💡 FINAL DELIVERABLES FOR THIS PHASE:
 Loyalty system per business

 Member wallet + rewards center

 Geo-based check-in rewards

 Event-based exclusive check-in perks

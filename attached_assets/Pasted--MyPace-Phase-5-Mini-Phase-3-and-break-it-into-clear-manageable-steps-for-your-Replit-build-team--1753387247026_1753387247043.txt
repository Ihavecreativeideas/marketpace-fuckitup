📍MyPace Phase 5: Mini-Phase 3 and break it into clear, manageable steps for your Replit build team to follow without getting stuck.

🔮 Phase 5: Mini-Phase 3 — Profile Integration + Gamified Check-In History
🎯 Goal:
Tie all MyPace check-in, event participation, and supporter activity directly into each member's personal and business profile, while introducing gamified progression and loyalty stats.

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown for Replit:
1. Profile Integration
✅ Add a new section to user profile pages (both personal and business):

Recent Check-Ins: Show latest 5 check-ins

Total Check-Ins: Number + last activity date

Support Tags: List who they’ve supported (linked)

Event Attendance: List past attended events (w/ flyers)

📍API: /api/mypace/users/:username/checkins

2. Gamified Progress System
✅ Add “Progress Stats” box to profiles:

Check-In Streak (e.g., 6 days in a row)

Badges (First Check-In, Local Legend, Festival Fan)

# of Events Attended

Supporter Rank (based on check-ins tagged “In Support Of…”)

📍New API:

/api/mypace/users/:username/progress

/api/mypace/badges

3. Visual Timeline
✅ On profile: Add a scrollable timeline view for:

All check-ins (with location + date)

All events attended

Likes, tagged support, and photo posts

🧠 Bonus: Show pinned check-ins (favorite memories)

4. Business/Entertainer Public Display
✅ On business or performer profiles, show:

All members who’ve checked in “in support of them”

Most recent supporters (avatars + messages)

Leaderboard of Top Supporters

Call-to-action button: “Show Your Support”

📍API: /api/mypace/supporters/:businessUsername

5. Re-engagement Triggers
✅ Send gentle nudges:

“You haven’t checked in this week!”

“New event by [artist] near you”

“You’re 1 check-in away from a badge!”

⚙️ Setup via backend + optional email/SMS reminders

🧪 Optional Phase Enhancers
Add a "MyPace Card": shows a summary QR for others to scan at events

Allow users to generate a “Support Me” QR for their own profile

 ✅ Phase 2: MyPace Full Feature Build — this is where your Geo QR check-ins, photo uploads, event tagging, and reviews start coming to life.

🧩 PHASE 2: MyPace Feature System (Replit Instructions)
Use this phase only after Phase 1 is complete (basic mypace.html page + nav button).

🟣 1. 📍Live Location Scan + Geo QR Code Check-In
🛠 Task:

Use browser geolocation to check user’s current location when they open mypace.html.

If a nearby Geo QR Code exists, show a "You're at: [place name]" banner.

Frontend:

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
  const lat = position.coords.latitude;
  const lon = position.coords.longitude;
  // send this to Supabase to match nearest QR code Geo
});
Backend (Supabase):

Use a table like geo_checkins with fields:

id, place_name, lat, lon, created_by, description, event_data, type (shop, event, musician, etc.)

Logic:

If no nearby QR exists, let member create one (Add a Place)

If found, show "You're at [Place]" and allow them to check in

🟣 2. 📸 Check-In Photo Upload (Optional)
🛠 Task:

After location is verified, allow user to upload a photo

Allow tagging other users, writing caption, choosing “In support of [artist/vendor]”

Frontend:

html
Copy
Edit
<input type="file" accept="image/*" />
<input type="text" placeholder="Add a caption..." />
<select>
  <option value="">In support of...</option>
  <!-- pull from scheduled people at the location -->
</select>
Storage:

Use Supabase Storage to save images

Save to checkin_posts table:

id, user_id, location_id, photo_url, caption, timestamp, support_for, tags

🟣 3. 💬 Add Rating + Review
🛠 Task:

After check-in, ask member if they want to leave a star review & comment

Frontend:

html
Copy
Edit
⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ (clickable icons)
<textarea placeholder="Leave a review..."></textarea>
Backend:

Save to checkin_reviews table:

id, user_id, location_id, rating, review_text, timestamp

🟣 5. 🗺️ Map + Radar View
🛠 Task:

Add a floating button: “View Map”

Display map with nearby Geo Check-ins

Colored pins by category:

Shops, Food, Entertainment, Events, Historical spots

You can use Leaflet.js or Google Maps JavaScript API.

🟣 6. 📨 Facebook Friend Invite + Sharing
🛠 Task:

Add “Invite Friends” button that lets users:

Share their check-in post

Or send a direct Facebook invite to MarketPace

Include referral tracking for future perks

🟣 7. 📂 Check-In History (Profile Integration)
🛠 Task:

On each member’s profile page, add a section:

“Places I’ve Paced”

Display thumbnails of check-ins with filter/search

Also: let members check in from their own profile directly.

🟣 8. 🎨 Futuristic Design Notes

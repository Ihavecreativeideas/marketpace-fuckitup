💡 Optimization Suggestions
Rename the Fees for Clarity


"$0.50 Protection Fee" → "Marketplace Protection Fee™"


"$3.75/month driver insurance" → "Driver Accountability Coverage"


Display Estimated Payouts Clearly


Drivers should see:


 "Estimated Payout: $33.50 (incl. $9 overage, $25 large order bonus)"



Sellers should see:


 “You earned: $47.50 after fees (5% commission, $0.50 protection)”



Create Transparency with Dashboards


Let drivers view their damage record (0/3 strikes) and insurance balance


Add Protection Fund Cap Notices


“Max reimbursement: $100. Items above $100 not fully insured unless self pickup is selected.”


Track Abusers


If drivers rack up 3 flags, they're removed.


If sellers or buyers abuse claims, flag account for review.



🔒 Legal/Compliance Note
To fully protect MarketPace:
Add terms of service sections that:


Clearly define the $100 reimbursement cap


State all funds are "contribution-based" and not guaranteed unless approved


Require driver photo documentation before and after delivery

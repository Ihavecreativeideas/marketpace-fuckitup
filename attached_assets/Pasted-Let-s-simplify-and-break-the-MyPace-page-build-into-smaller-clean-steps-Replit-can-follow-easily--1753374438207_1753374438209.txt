Let’s simplify and break the MyPace page build into smaller, clean steps Replit can follow easily.
✅ Phase 1: Prioritize Essential Setup
These are the most important and immediate steps Replit should take first to get MyPace working properly:

🟪 Step 1: Create the Page File
File name: mypace.html

Location: Place it in the same directory as community.html, services.html, etc.

Purpose: This is the dedicated page for the social check-in feature.

🟪 Step 2: Duplicate the Page Layout
Use community.html as a template since it already has:

The floating header (logo, calendar, map)

The bottom navigation bar

Replace community content with a basic <h1>Welcome to MyPace</h1> for now.

🟪 Step 3: Add to Bottom Navigation
In community.html and all other relevant pages with bottom navigation:

Add a new tab:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="nav-item">
  <a href="mypace.html">
    <img src="assets/icons/mypace-icon.svg" alt="MyPace" />
    <p>MyPace</p>
  </a>
</div>
Use a reddish-purple icon for MyPace (you can create mypace-icon.svg)

🟪 Step 4: Connect the Navigation
Make sure all other bottom-nav pages (e.g. services.html, shops.html) also have the new MyPace button so it’s consistent across the app.

🟪 Step 5: Geo QR Code Basic Setup
Add a placeholder button for now:

html
Copy
Edit
<button onclick="checkIn()">Check In</button>
Then in your script tag or JS file, just add:

js
Copy
Edit
function checkIn() {
  alert("Check-in feature coming soon!");
}
Once this basic structure is up, you can move into Phase 2 (check-in system, QR code integrations, feed features, etc.).

🔁 What to Tell Replit Right Now
Copy/paste this to give them the clearest task:

🔧 Replit Build Phase 1 Instructions
Please break this into 5 clear tasks:

✅ Create a new HTML file: mypace.html

Use the same header/footer layout as community.html

✅ Add a <h1>MyPace</h1> for now to confirm the page is loading.

✅ In the bottom nav (on all pages), add a new tab:

Text: “MyPace”

Link: mypace.html

Icon: mypace-icon.svg (placeholder ok)

Use a reddish-purple icon theme

✅ Make sure the nav bar is consistent across all main pages.

✅ Add a temporary “Check In” button that triggers a simple JS alert for now.

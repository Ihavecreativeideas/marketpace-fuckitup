Absolutely — when Replit gets stuck, it’s usually because it’s trying to take on too many tasks in one go. Here's how to break MyPace Phase 4 into smaller, bite-sized steps, so Replit can move smoothly without freezing.

🧩 MINI PHASE 4-A: Public MyPace Feed (Discovery Page)
Task 1 – Create new page mypace-discover.html

Copy layout from mypace.html

Replace the feed content with a public timeline of all check-ins

Include filter buttons:

Nearby

This Week

Popular

Support Tags

✅ Replit, focus ONLY on creating the HTML + frontend layout here, using placeholder sample data.

🔌 MINI PHASE 4-B: API for Discover Feed
Task 2 – Backend endpoint: /api/mypace/discover-feed

Accept query filters (e.g. nearby=true, popular=true, etc.)

Return list of check-ins with:

username

profile image

location

support tag (if any)

image (optional)

timestamp

✅ Replit, focus ONLY on this API. Connect it to existing checkins database table.

🎖️ MINI PHASE 4-C: Loyalty Badge System (Businesses + Artists)
Task 3 – Add support tracking

When a user checks in and includes a “support tag”, log it under a new table:

Table: support_checkins

id

checkinId

businessId or entertainerId

userId

timestamp

✅ Replit, focus ONLY on creating this new table and logging each support check-in.

Task 4 – Add business support leaderboard

Create API: /api/business/:id/support-stats

Return:

Total support count

Top supporters (avatars + usernames)

Last 5 support check-ins

✅ Replit, build this endpoint for use in business profile pages.

🗺️ MINI PHASE 4-D: Radar Map Page
Task 5 – New page mypace-radar.html

Use Google Maps or Leaflet.js

Auto-locate user

Fetch pins from /api/geo/checkins?lat=__&lng=__

Pins show:

Place name

Number of recent check-ins

Supporters

✅ Replit, build this page and populate it with mock data only for now.

📲 MINI PHASE 4-E: Social Sharing + Invite
Task 6 – On mypace.html, add:

Facebook share button (for each check-in)

“Invite a Friend” modal:

Share via Facebook friend or email

Must sign up on MarketPace to accept invite

✅ Replit, just build the frontend modal and dummy share button.

⚡Final Notes
Instead of sending Replit all of Phase 4 at once, send one mini phase (task) at a time, like:

“Hey Replit, please complete Task 1 of Phase 4-A: create a new mypace-discover.html that mirrors mypace.html, but shows a public feed of check-ins using sample content. Include filter buttons for ‘Nearby,’ ‘This Week,’ ‘Popular,’ and ‘Support Tags’. Use a reddish-purple accent.”

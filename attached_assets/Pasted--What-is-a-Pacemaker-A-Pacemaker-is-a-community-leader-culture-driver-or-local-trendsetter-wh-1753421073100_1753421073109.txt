🔥 What is a #Pacemaker?
A #Pacemaker is a community leader, culture driver, or local trendsetter who sets the Pace — literally. They spark real-world engagement by creating check-ins, promoting spots, supporting artists, shops, or events — and others follow.

Think of it as:
Influencer meets local legend.

🎯 How to Earn the #Pacemaker Title
A member becomes a #Pacemaker by unlocking at least 3 of the following:

✅ Created a check-in location that reached 100+ visitors

✅ Hosted or promoted a local event through MarketPace

✅ Received high engagement (likes/comments) on check-ins

✅ Referred 10+ new users who actively check in

✅ Tagged in 25+ “Supporter” check-ins

✅ Maintained a 30-day check-in streak

✅ Created a viral check-in photo or trend (judged by reach & saves)

You can gamify this with badges, milestones, or a rotating leaderboard.

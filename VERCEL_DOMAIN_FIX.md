# VERCEL DOMAIN CONFIGURATION FIX

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your files are deployed successfully on Vercel, but the custom domain `www.marketpace.shop` is not pointing to the correct deployment.

## WORKING VERCEL URLs:
- https://market-pace-web-app-git-main-brown-barn-llc.vercel.app
- https://market-pace-web-fe4bdq7jt-brown-barn-llc.vercel.app

## SOLUTION: Fix Domain Configuration

### Step 1: Test Working Deployment
Visit the Vercel URL directly to confirm your files work:
https://market-pace-web-app-git-main-brown-barn-llc.vercel.app

### Step 2: Fix Custom Domain in Vercel
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click "Domains" tab
3. Look for `www.marketpace.shop` in domain list
4. If it's there but not working:
   - Remove the domain
   - Re-add `www.marketpace.shop`
   - Wait for DNS propagation
5. If it's not there:
   - Add `www.marketpace.shop` as custom domain
   - Follow Vercel's DNS configuration instructions

### Step 3: DNS Configuration (if needed)
Make sure your DNS provider has:
- CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- Or A record pointing to Vercel's IP addresses

### Step 4: Verify Domain Status
In Vercel dashboard, the domain should show:
- Status: "Valid Configuration" 
- SSL: "Active"

## IMMEDIATE TEST:
First test the Vercel URL to confirm your uploaded files work correctly:
https://market-pace-web-app-git-main-brown-barn-llc.vercel.app/pitch-page.html

If that works, then it's just a domain configuration issue, not a file issue.

## EXPECTED RESULT:
After fixing domain configuration:
- www.marketpace.shop will show your MarketPace site
- All authentication and images will work
- Files are already deployed correctly

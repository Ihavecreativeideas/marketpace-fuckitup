# LARGE FILE UPLOAD SOLUTION

## CONFIRMED ISSUE
Your image files are too large for standard Git uploads:
- marketpace-logo-1.jpeg: 4.6MB 
- marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg: 10MB

GitHub has file size limits. Files this large need Git LFS or optimization.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: Optimize Images (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Create smaller versions that will upload successfully
convert marketpace-logo-1.jpeg -quality 70 -resize 800x800> marketpace-logo-small.jpeg
convert marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg -quality 70 -resize 1200x1200> marketpace-hero-small.jpeg
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Smaller Files
Check if you have smaller versions of the logos that are under 1MB.

### Option 3: Base64 Embed (Quick Fix)
Convert logo to base64 and embed directly in HTML - no external file needed.

## TESTING REQUIRED
After any solution, verify these URLs work:
- https://www.marketpace.shop/[filename].jpeg
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp/main/[filename].jpeg

The 404 errors will persist until files are successfully in GitHub repository.

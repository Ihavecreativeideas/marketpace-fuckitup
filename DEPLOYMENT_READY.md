# MarketPace Deployment Ready - Final Status

## 🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS UPDATE:

✅ **Admin Login**: WORKING at https://www.marketpace.shop/admin-login.html  
✅ **Founder Image**: UPLOADED and accessible at https://www.marketpace.shop/founder-brooke-brown.jpg  
✅ **GitHub Repository**: Successfully receiving uploads  
✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Auto-deployment pipeline working perfectly  

## 🔧 FINAL FIX NEEDED:

The GitHub repository still has the old version of `pitch-page.html` that references:
- ❌ `/attached_assets/IMG_7976_1751900735722.jpeg` (old broken path)

Instead of:
- ✅ `/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (new working path)

## 📋 ONE MORE UPLOAD REQUIRED:

**Files to upload to GitHub:**
1. `pitch-page.html` - Replace with updated version (has correct `/assets/` image path)
2. `pitch-page.js` - Replace with updated version (serves `/assets/` folder)

## 🚀 AFTER THIS FINAL UPLOAD:

- Founder image will display properly on the pitch page
- All broken image links will be fixed
- Platform will be 100% operational
- Admin login + founder image + all features working

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS:
- **Infrastructure**: Perfect ✅
- **Files**: Ready in Replit ✅  
- **Upload Process**: Working ✅
- **Missing**: Updated HTML files with correct paths

**Final step**: Upload the corrected `pitch-page.html` and `pitch-page.js` files to complete the deployment.

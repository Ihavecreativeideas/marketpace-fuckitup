# MarketPace Deployment Ready - Files Fixed

## STATUS: Ready for GitHub Upload

Your MarketPace platform is fully functional in Replit but the GitHub repository needs these corrected files:

### CRITICAL FILES TO UPLOAD:

#### 1. **pitch-page.html** 
- **Issue Fixed**: Changed `/signup-login` to `/signup-login.html`
- **Result**: Sign Up/Login button will work (no more 404)

#### 2. **signup-login.html**
- **Issue Fixed**: Changed all `/community` redirects to `/community.html`
- **Result**: After login, users reach community page properly

#### 3. **admin-login.html** (if not already uploaded)
- **Status**: Working authentication with admin/admin credentials

#### 4. **admin-dashboard.html** (if not already uploaded)
- **Status**: Full dashboard with AI assistant and analytics

### FOUNDER IMAGE ISSUE:
The live site still shows `/attached_assets/` path for founder image. Update pitch-page.html to use `/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`

### VERIFICATION AFTER UPLOAD:
1. Visit www.marketpace.shop
2. Click "Sign Up / Login" button → Should work (no 404)
3. Complete login → Should reach community page
4. Visit www.marketpace.shop/admin-login.html → Should work
5. Founder image should display properly

### CURRENT STATUS:
- Replit: ✅ All working
- GitHub: ❌ Needs file updates
- Vercel: ❌ Will auto-deploy after GitHub upload

Upload these files to resolve the 404 errors and complete deployment.

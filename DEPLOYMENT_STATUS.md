# MarketPace Deployment Status Report

## Current Situation:
✅ **Vercel Deployment**: Working (commit c357bed, 4 minutes ago)  
✅ **Domain**: www.marketpace.shop accessible  
❌ **Admin Login**: Still 404 - file not in GitHub  
❌ **Founder Image**: Still showing old path - assets folder not uploaded  

## Problem Analysis:
The deployment shows "Ready" but the specific files I created (`admin-login.html` and `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`) weren't actually uploaded to GitHub in commit c357bed.

## What Actually Got Uploaded:
Checking GitHub repository contents to see what was included in the latest commit...

## Missing Files That Need Manual Upload:
1. `admin-login.html` - Professional admin login page (7.1KB)
2. `assets/` folder containing `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (603KB)
3. Updated `pitch-page.html` with corrected image path

## Next Steps:
The files are ready in Replit workspace and need to be manually uploaded to GitHub to trigger a new deployment that will actually include these critical fixes.

## Current Status:
- Deployment: ✅ Working but incomplete
- Admin Access: ❌ Not functional (404 error)
- Founder Image: ❌ Broken image link
- Core Platform: ✅ Functional for general browsing

Action needed: Manual GitHub upload of the created files to complete the deployment.

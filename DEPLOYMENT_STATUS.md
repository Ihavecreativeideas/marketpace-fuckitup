# Deployment Status Update

## Current Status: Security Checkpoint Disabled

You've successfully disabled the Vercel security checkpoint, but the system shows:
"A new Deployment is required for your changes to take effect."

## Next Steps:

### 1. Trigger New Deployment
Go to your Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments tab:
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
- This will apply the security changes AND pull any GitHub updates

### 2. Expected Results After Deployment:
- Security checkpoint should be gone
- Site should load normally
- You'll finally see if cyan theme update worked

### 3. If Site Loads Without Cyan Theme:
This means the GitHub file update didn't work properly, and we'll need to:
- Verify the GitHub repository exists and is accessible
- Manually update the pitch-page.html file in GitHub
- Ensure the cyan theme code is properly saved

### 4. If Site Shows Cyan Theme:
Success! The deployment process worked and your beautiful futuristic design is live.

## Timeline:
- Deployment: 2-3 minutes
- Site accessibility: Immediate after deployment
- DNS propagation: May take additional 5-10 minutes globally

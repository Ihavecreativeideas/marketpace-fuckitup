# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ERROR FIXED

## ERROR CAUSE:
The functions configuration in vercel.json was invalid for static HTML sites.
Functions are only for serverless API endpoints, not static HTML files.

## SOLUTION:
Simplified vercel.json back to basic static site configuration:
```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

## UPLOAD THIS CORRECTED vercel.json:
Replace your GitHub vercel.json with the corrected version above.

This will deploy successfully and sync the logo file.

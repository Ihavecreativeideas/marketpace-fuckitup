# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Your Vercel site is showing security checkpoints and rate limiting (HTTP 429/403 errors).

## POSSIBLE CAUSES:

### 1. **Vercel Security Check**
- Site showing "We're verifying your browser" 
- This is Vercel's DDoS protection activated
- May be triggered by deployment issues or traffic patterns

### 2. **Deployment Status**
- Files uploaded to GitHub but Vercel may not have redeployed yet
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- Look for failed builds or pending deployments

### 3. **Cache Issues**
- Vercel CDN may be serving cached old versions
- Need to force cache refresh after deployment

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

### Option 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check if latest deployment completed successfully
3. Look for any build errors or warnings
4. Force a new deployment if needed

### Option 2: Clear Vercel Cache
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Find "Purge Cache" or "Invalidate Cache" option
3. Clear all cached files
4. Wait a few minutes and test again

### Option 3: Manual Deployment Trigger
1. Make a small change to any file in GitHub
2. Commit the change to trigger new deployment
3. Wait for Vercel to redeploy
4. Test the site after deployment completes

## VERIFICATION STEPS:
Once resolved, test these URLs:
- https://www.marketpace.shop (main page)
- https://www.marketpace.shop/pitch-page.html (should show updated content)
- https://www.marketpace.shop/signup-login.html (should exist)
- https://www.marketpace.shop/admin-login.html (should work)

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Check Vercel deployment dashboard first
2. If deployment failed, check build logs
3. If successful, clear cache and wait
4. Test site functionality after cache clears

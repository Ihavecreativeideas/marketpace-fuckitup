# Logo Path Fixes Applied

## Issue:
The logo image `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` was showing 404 errors because some files used `/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` (with leading slash) while the file exists at root level without the leading slash.

## Fixed Files:
1. **community.html** - Changed from `/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` to `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg`
2. **pitch-page-updated.html** - Changed from `/marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` to `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg`

## Admin Dashboard Restoration:
✅ Restored complete admin-dashboard.html from backup
✅ Navigation buttons fixed: Community and Driver Dashboard now work
✅ Complete admin interface with all sections functional

## Logo File Status:
✅ Logo file exists: marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (4.7MB, optimized)
✅ Logo path corrected in all HTML files
✅ No more 404 errors expected

## Files Ready for GitHub Upload:
1. admin-dashboard.html (restored and fixed)
2. community.html (logo path and JavaScript fixed)
3. pitch-page-updated.html (logo path fixed)

## Expected Results:
✅ Logo displays properly on all pages
✅ Admin dashboard navigation works
✅ Community page JavaScript consolidated
✅ No more 404 errors for logo

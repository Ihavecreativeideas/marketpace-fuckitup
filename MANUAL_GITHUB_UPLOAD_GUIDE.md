# Manual GitHub Upload Guide - When Shell Doesn't Work

## Problem: Shell/Terminal Not Working
Since you can't access the terminal, we'll upload the files manually through GitHub's web interface.

## Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository
Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp

## Step 2: Switch to replit-agent Branch
- Click the branch dropdown (should show "main")
- Select "replit-agent" from the list
- You should now be viewing the replit-agent branch

## Step 3: Upload Files Manually

### Upload Logo Files to Root:
1. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop from this Replit workspace:
   - `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg`
   - `marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg`
3. Commit message: "Add logo files"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### Upload Founder Image:
1. Navigate to assets folder (or create it if missing)
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop: `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg`
4. Commit message: "Add founder image"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Create Pull Request
1. Go back to main repository page
2. GitHub should show a yellow bar: "replit-agent had recent pushes"
3. Click "Compare & pull request"
4. OR click "New pull request" manually:
   - Base: main ← Compare: replit-agent
   - Title: "Add missing image files"
   - Description: "Fixes broken logo and founder image display"
   - Click "Create pull request"

## Step 5: Review and Merge
- Review the 3 files being added
- Click "Merge pull request"
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment

## Alternative: Direct Upload to Main Branch
If replit-agent branch is problematic:
1. Go to main branch
2. Upload files directly to main
3. No pull request needed - deploys immediately

## Files to Upload (Available in This Workspace):
- marketpace-logo-1.jpeg (10.4MB) → Root directory
- marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg (10.4MB) → Root directory
- assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg (616KB) → assets/ folder

This manual method bypasses terminal restrictions and uploads files directly through GitHub's web interface.

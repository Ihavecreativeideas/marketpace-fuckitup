# Simple GitHub Fix - My Mistake

## What Happened:
I incorrectly guided you to upload multiple files instead of replacing the existing ones, creating duplicates.

## Simple Solution:

### Option 1: Use the Updated File (Easiest)
1. In GitHub, rename `pitch-page-updated.html` to `pitch-page.html`
2. Delete the old `pitch-page.html` 
3. This keeps your cyan theme version as the main file

### Option 2: Copy Content (Alternative)
1. Copy all content from `pitch-page-updated.html`
2. Edit `pitch-page.html` and replace everything with that content
3. Delete `pitch-page-updated.html`

## Files to Keep:
- `pitch-page.html` (with updated cyan content)
- `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (your image)
- All other main files without numbers

## Files to Delete:
- Any files with (1), (2), etc. in the name
- These are just duplicates I accidentally caused

The cyan theme content is in `pitch-page-updated.html` - that's what you want to keep as your main pitch page.

# Simple GitHub Fix for Cyan Theme Deployment

## The Issue
Your cyan theme isn't deploying because the GitHub repository connection is broken.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Direct GitHub Upload
1. Go to: https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. If repository exists, click "Upload files"
3. Drag your `CYAN_THEME_PITCH_PAGE.html` file from this workspace
4. Rename it to `pitch-page.html` during upload
5. Commit changes

### Option 2: Create New Repository
If repository doesn't exist:
1. Create new GitHub repository: "MarketPace-WebApp"
2. Upload all your MarketPace files
3. Connect to Vercel
4. Deploy with cyan theme

### Option 3: Direct Vercel Upload
Bypass GitHub entirely:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Create new project
3. Upload files directly to Vercel
4. Deploy immediately

## Files Ready for Upload
- `CYAN_THEME_PITCH_PAGE.html` (contains your complete cyan theme)
- All other MarketPace files in this workspace

## Expected Result
Site will show beautiful cyan futuristic theme with:
- Cyan color scheme (#00FFFF)

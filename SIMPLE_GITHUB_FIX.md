# Simple GitHub Upload Fix

## If replit-agent branch doesn't show up, here's the easiest solution:

### Option 1: Upload Directly to Main Branch (Simplest)
1. Go to https://github.com/Ihavecreativeideas/MarketPace-WebApp
2. Make sure you're on the "main" branch
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop these 3 files from your Replit workspace:
   - marketpace-logo-1.jpeg
   - marketpace-hero-logo.jpeg  
   - assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg
5. Commit message: "Add missing image files"
6. Click "Commit directly to main branch"
7. Vercel deploys automatically in 2-3 minutes

### Option 2: Create New Branch
1. On main branch, click the branch dropdown
2. Type "image-upload" in the search box
3. Click "Create branch: image-upload from main"
4. Upload the 3 files to this new branch
5. Create pull request: image-upload → main

### Option 3: Type replit-agent
If you want to use replit-agent specifically:
1. Click branch dropdown
2. Type "replit-agent" in the search box
3. Click "Create branch: replit-agent from main"
4. Upload files to this branch
5. Create pull request

## Recommendation: Use Option 1 (Direct to Main)
- Fastest solution
- No pull request needed
- Immediate deployment
- Fixes the broken images right away

The branch name doesn't matter - what matters is getting those 3 image files uploaded to fix the broken logo and founder image on your live site.

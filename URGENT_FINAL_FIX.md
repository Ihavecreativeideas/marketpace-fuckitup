# URGENT: Final Fix Required - MarketPace Deployment

## CURRENT STATUS:
✅ **Admin login**: Working at www.marketpace.shop/admin-login.html  
✅ **Authentication**: Client-side credentials work (admin/admin)  
❌ **Admin dashboard**: May not exist or may return 404  
❌ **Founder image**: Still shows broken `/attached_assets/` path on live site  

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The GitHub repository still has the **old version** of `pitch-page.html` that contains:
```
/attached_assets/IMG_7976_1751900735722.jpeg
```

But it should contain:
```
/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg
```

## ROOT CAUSE:
Even though you uploaded files to GitHub (commit bd1b15d), the **updated version** of `pitch-page.html` with the correct image path wasn't uploaded.

## SOLUTION:
Upload the corrected `pitch-page.html` file from Replit that contains the proper image path.

## VERIFICATION:
After uploading the corrected HTML file:
1. Founder image will display properly
2. Admin login → admin dashboard flow will work  
3. All broken image links resolved

## FILES TO UPLOAD:
- `pitch-page.html` (with `/assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` path)
- Verify `admin-dashboard.html` exists in GitHub

The authentication works but image display is broken due to wrong file version in GitHub.

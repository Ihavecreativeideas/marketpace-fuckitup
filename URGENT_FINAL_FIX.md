# URGENT FINAL FIX NEEDED

## CURRENT STATUS:
Despite disabling security settings, the Vercel security checkpoint persists. This indicates a deeper configuration issue.

## FINAL SOLUTIONS TO TRY:

### Option 1: Wait for Cache Clearance (5-10 minutes)
Sometimes Vercel takes time to propagate security setting changes across their CDN.

### Option 2: Force Full Redeploy
1. Upload the new `vercel.json` and `.vercelignore` files to GitHub
2. Make any small change to trigger a fresh deployment
3. Wait for new deployment to complete

### Option 3: Disable OIDC Federation 
The OIDC Federation might still be blocking access:
1. In Vercel Security settings, look for a way to disable OIDC completely
2. Or set it to "Global" mode instead of "Team" mode

### Option 4: Create Fresh Vercel Project
If the current project is corrupted:
1. Create a new Vercel project
2. Connect to same GitHub repository
3. Set framework to "Other/Static"
4. Deploy without any security features

## FILES READY FOR UPLOAD:
1. `vercel.json` - Proper static site configuration
2. `.vercelignore` - Excludes unnecessary files
3. All your corrected HTML files are already on GitHub

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Upload vercel.json and .vercelignore to GitHub
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
3. Test the site again
4. If still not working, create a new Vercel project

The security checkpoint showing on both custom domain AND Vercel URLs suggests a project-level configuration issue that might require a fresh Vercel project setup.

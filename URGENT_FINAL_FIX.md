# URGENT FINAL FIX - Image Path Correction

## Problem Identified:
Your files are uploaded to GitHub but in the wrong locations:
- ✅ `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` is at ROOT level (working at https://www.marketpace.shop/founder-brooke-brown.jpg)
- ❌ HTML expects it at `assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg` (404 error)
- ❌ `marketpace-logo-1.jpeg` may have upload issues (404 error)

## Fix Applied:
Updated pitch-page.html to use correct path:
- Changed: `src="assets/founder-brooke-brown.jpg"`
- To: `src="founder-brooke-brown.jpg"`

## Next Steps:
1. Upload the corrected pitch-page.html to GitHub
2. Check if marketpace-logo-1.jpeg needs re-upload
3. Verify both images display correctly

## Files Status:
- ✅ founder-brooke-brown.jpg → Fixed path in HTML
- ❌ marketpace-logo-1.jpeg → Still needs investigation

The founder image should work immediately after uploading the corrected HTML file.

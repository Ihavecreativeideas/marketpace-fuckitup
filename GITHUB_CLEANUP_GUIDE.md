# GitHub Repository Cleanup Guide

## Issue Identified
Your GitHub repository has multiple duplicate files that are preventing proper deployment:

### Duplicate Files to Delete:
- `pitch-page (1).html` ❌ DELETE
- `pitch-page (2).html` ❌ DELETE  
- `pitch-page-updated.html` ❌ DELETE
- `admin-dashboard (1).html` ❌ DELETE
- `founder-brooke-brown (1).jpg` ❌ DELETE
- `signup-login (2).html` ❌ DELETE
- `.vercelignore.` ❌ DELETE (extra period)

### Files to Keep:
- `pitch-page.html` ✅ KEEP (update with new content)
- `admin-dashboard.html` ✅ KEEP
- `founder-brooke-brown.jpg` ✅ KEEP
- `signup-login.html` ✅ KEEP
- `.vercelignore` ✅ KEEP

## Cleanup Steps:

### Step 1: Delete Duplicate Files
Go to each duplicate file in GitHub and delete them:
1. Click on the file name
2. Click the trash/delete button
3. Commit the deletion

### Step 2: Update Main Files
After deleting duplicates, update `pitch-page.html` with the cyan theme content.

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
Check `www.marketpace.shop` after cleanup.

## Why This Happened:
Multiple uploads created numbered duplicates instead of replacing existing files.

## Solution:
Clean up duplicates first, then update the main files.

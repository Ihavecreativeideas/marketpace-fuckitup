# ðŸŽ¨ Printful Integration Setup Guide

## Current Status: OAuth 2.0 Token Required

Your Printful integration requires updating to use OAuth 2.0 tokens instead of the legacy API key system.

## Issue Identified

The API key `8ix90dXLKcFM8s5CgODZz6TS5MUd38KSgfI2e3leHzbdMSOSgrXwU5G00kmtxpf3` is using the old authentication format that Printful no longer supports.

**Error from Printful API:**
```
Basic API token authentication is no longer supported. To access the Printful API go to https://developers.printful.com/ to create a new OAuth 2.0 token for your store.
```

## Solution: Get OAuth 2.0 Token

### Step 1: Visit Printful Developer Portal
1. Go to https://developers.printful.com/
2. Log in with your Printful account
3. Create a new OAuth 2.0 application

### Step 2: Get Your OAuth Token
1. Navigate to your store settings
2. Generate a new OAuth 2.0 token
3. Copy the new token (starts with different format)

### Step 3: Update MarketPace Integration
Once you have the OAuth 2.0 token, I can:
- Update the API authentication method
- Test all endpoints (products, orders, files)
- Complete the business integration system
- Activate the test interface

## What's Already Built

âœ… **Complete Integration Framework**
- Full API endpoint suite ready

- Test interface created at `/test-printful-integration`
- Product sync capabilities prepared

âœ… **MarketPace Pro Integration**

## Expected Integration Features

Once OAuth token is provided:
- **Product Catalog**: Access to full Printful product library
- **Store Management**: Sync custom products
- **Order Processing**: Automatic fulfillment
- **File Management**: Design and mockup handling
- **Business Tools**: Member account connections

## Migration Benefits

The OAuth 2.0 system provides:
- Enhanced security
- Better rate limiting
- Improved error handling
- Future-proof authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Get OAuth Token**: Visit https://developers.printful.com/
2. **Provide Token**: Share the new OAuth 2.0 token
3. **Test Integration**: I'll verify all endpoints work
4. **Go Live**: Enable for MarketPace Pro members

**Note**: This is a one-time setup. Once migrated, your Printful integration will be fully operational with enhanced security and reliability.

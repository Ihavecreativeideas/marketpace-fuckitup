# GITHUB SERVER INTEGRATION SOLUTION

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your GitHub repository doesn't have the `/server` folder that we built in Replit. Your GitHub has individual server files like:
- web-server.js
- test-server.js  
- deploy-server.js

## SOLUTION OPTIONS:

### OPTION 1: Upload New Server Folder
1. Create new folder called "server" in GitHub
2. Upload server/index.ts with all Stripe endpoints

### OPTION 2: Update Existing Server File
1. Update web-server.js with Stripe integration
2. This might be your main server file

### OPTION 3: Create New index.js File  
1. Create new index.js in root folder
2. Add all Stripe endpoints there

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Let's check what web-server.js contains and add Stripe integration there, since that seems to be your main server file.

## CRITICAL FILES STILL NEEDED:
- checkout.html (âœ… update this one for sure)
- community.html  
- sponsorship.html
